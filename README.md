sentiment_analysis_system
==============================

Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text.
It identifies and categorizes opinions expressed in a text, typically as positive, negative, or neutral.
This method is widely applied in areas such as customer feedback, social media analysis, and product reviews to understand public sentiment and improve decision-making

The model is designed to analyze sentiments across four distinct categories:
1. Neutral: Sentences with no clear emotional leaning.
2. Positive: Sentences expressing optimism, happiness, or positivity.
3. Negative: Sentences reflecting dissatisfaction, anger, or negativity.
4. Suicidal: Sentences indicating thoughts of self-harm or suicidal intent.
